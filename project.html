    <h1> How does campaign finance spending affect elections to the US House of Representatives? </h1>
    <h2> Aims </h2>
    <p> The influence of money on politics has been a frequent topic of debate in recent years. In the United States, campaign finances are regulated by the Federal
        Election Comission (FEC), but these regulations are generally more lenient than similar regulations enforced in the UK. By focusing on elections to the
        House of Representatives in 2020 - which has the most comprehensive campaign finance data available - this project seeks to investigate the extent to which
        campaign finances influence the outcome of elections, while also considering why some campaigns raise more money than others. </p> 
    <h2> The relationship between campaign finances and election outcomes </h2> 
    <p> In order to create a dataset detailing the outcome of elections in 2020, I <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/politico_scraping.py">scraped</a>
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/politico_2020_house.csv">data</a> 
        from <a class="textLink" href="https://www.politico.com">Politico </a>. I also 
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/open_secrets_scraping.py">scraped</a> 
        data from <a class="textLink" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a> to obtain financial
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_finances_2020_open_secrets.csv">data</a> 
        for candidates in these elections. </p> 
    <p> These sources had data with differing formatting, as field such as candidate and district name had contrasting formats. In order to produce a useable
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_2020_results_and_finances_final.csv">dataset</a>
        I merged and cleaned data from these sources in <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/politico_open_secrets_merge_clean.py">Python</a>.
        I also had to drop some data, as not all house seats had financial data available for all candidates. The following chart plots a regression of a candidate's final
        vote share against the percentage of the total money in their seat they were responsible for spending/raising. </p>        
    <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
    <p> The data shows a positive correlation between how much more a candidate has raised or spent than their opponent and final vote share. In our dataset of 341 seats
        with winners, in 294 seats the bigger spender won, and in 297 the candidate who raised the most won. As most candidates spend close to all the money they raise, 
        unsurprisingly there is little variation between considering money raised and money spent. </p>
    <p> Although we can say that generally the candidate that spends the most wins, we cannot contribute this solely to the presence of greater finances. Increased
        finances help candidates with advertising and staffing, but also reflect initial popularity. </p>
    <p> Another perspective to consider is where the money comes from. OpenSecrets provide <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_2020_in_out_district_open_secrets.csv">data</a>
        on the proportion of money a candidate receives from within their seat, which we can <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/in_out_district_merge.py">manipulate</a>
        to produce a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/in_distr_raised_2020.csv">dataset</a>
        showing the relative amount of in-district money a candidate raised. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
    <p> As in-district donations represent popularity among voting constituents and as people may be more likely to donate afar to high-profile candidates in uncompetitive
        races, we might expect in-district donations to have a greater impact than other donations. However, this is not borne out in the data, as although money raised
        in-district is correlated with vote share, the effect isn't as great as when considering the total amount raised. </p>
