    <h1> How does campaign finance spending affect elections to the US House of Representatives? </h1>
    <h2> Aims </h2>
    <p> The influence of money on politics has been a frequent topic of debate in recent years. In the United States, campaign finances are regulated by the Federal
        Election Commission (FEC), but these regulations are generally more lenient than similar regulations enforced in the UK. By focusing on elections to the
        House of Representatives in 2020 - which has the most comprehensive campaign finance data available - this project seeks to investigate the extent to which
        campaign finances influence the outcome of elections, while also considering why some campaigns raise more money than others. </p> 
    <h2> The relationship between campaign finances and election outcomes </h2> 
    <p> In order to create a dataset detailing the outcome of elections in 2020, I <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/politico_scraping.py">scraped</a>
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/politico_2020_house.csv">data</a> 
        from <a class="textLink" href="https://www.politico.com">Politico </a>. I also 
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/open_secrets_scraping.py">scraped</a> 
        data from <a class="textLink" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a> to obtain financial
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_finances_2020_open_secrets.csv">data</a> 
        for candidates in these elections. </p> 
    <p> These sources had data with differing formatting, as field such as candidate and district name had contrasting formats. In order to produce a useable
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_2020_results_and_finances_final.csv">dataset</a>
        I merged and cleaned data from these sources in <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/politico_open_secrets_merge_clean.py">Python</a>.
        I also had to drop some data, as not all house seats had financial data available for all candidates. The following chart plots a regression of a candidate's final
        vote share against the percentage of the total money in their seat they were responsible for spending/raising. </p>        
    <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
    <p> The data shows a positive correlation between how much more a candidate has raised or spent than their opponent and final vote share. As most candidates spend close to all the money they raise, 
        unsurprisingly there is little variation between considering money raised and money spent. </p>
    <p> Although we can say that generally the candidate that spends the most wins, we cannot contribute this solely to the presence of greater finances. Increased
        finances help candidates with advertising and staffing, but also reflect initial popularity. </p>
    <p> Another perspective to consider is where the money comes from. OpenSecrets provide <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_2020_in_out_district_open_secrets.csv">data</a>
        on the proportion of money a candidate receives from within their seat, which we can <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/in_out_district_merge.py">manipulate</a>
        to produce a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/in_distr_raised_2020.csv">dataset</a>
        showing the relative amount of in-district money a candidate raised. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
    <p> As in-district donations represent popularity among voting constituents and as people may be more likely to donate afar to high-profile candidates in uncompetitive
        races, we might expect in-district donations to have a greater impact than other donations. However, this is not borne out in the data, as although money raised
        in-district is correlated with vote share, the effect isn't as great as when considering the total amount raised. </p>
    <p> MIT's Election <a class="textLink" href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/data">Lab</a> contains
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/2018_2020_house_results.csv">data</a>
        on House results in both 2018 and 2020, which we can <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/results_clean_2018_2020.py">manipulate</a>
        to get a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_winners_2018_2020.csv">dataset</a>
        showing which party won each seat. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
    <p> By considering the two maps, it is clear that an overwhelming majority of seats were retained by the party that held them. Although campaign finance can
        affect outcomes, constituencies have demographics and partisan leans which are difficult to overcome. </p>
    <h2> Why some races are more expensive than others </h2>
    <p> We can <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/district_totals.py">analyse</a>
        our data to show the total spent on each <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/district_totals_2020.csv">seat</a>,
        and plot a histogram showing the distribution of totals spent. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
    <p> The histogram shows that an overwhelming majority of seats receive modest investment, with a select few receiving many multiples more. One possible explanation
        is that people are more likely to give to candidates in closely-fought races where their donations can make a difference. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
    <p> The chart shows that there seems to be limited correlation between the margin of victory and the total spend, so it is not clear that people tend to donate
        to tight races. We can plot a map showing where the most was spent. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div> 
    <p> There is considerable geographic variation, but it is notable that high-spending races seem to occur in big, wealthy states such as California, New York and
        Texas. We can use census <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/census_household_income_2019.csv">data</a> 
        and <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/household_income_merge.py">clean</a>
        it to create a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/district_totals_household_income_2020.csv">dataset</a>
        that allows to consider whether expensive races are more likely to occur in wealthier places. </p> 
    <div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div>
    <p> There seems to be no clear pattern, with most of the seats which received the greatest investments having relatively normal median household incomes.
        In reality, most expensive races involve high-profile candidates and powerful politicians, so these races are important to parties 
        and attract significant media attention. </p>
    <h2> Conclusions </h2>
    <p> We have seen that candidates who raise and spend more tend to perform better electorally, although raising money may also reflect their initial popularity.
    A diverse range of seats attract high-investment, but generally the highest expenditures occur in races featuring high-profile candidates. Further investigation could
    involve accounting for initial popularity (e.g. using polling), looking at changes in campaign finance over time, or analysing the effectiveness of different
    expenditures, such as advertising. </p>
