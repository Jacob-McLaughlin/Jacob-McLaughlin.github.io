    <h1> How does campaign finance spending affect elections to the US House of Representatives? </h1>
    <h2> Aims </h2>
    <p> The influence of money on politics has been a frequent topic of debate in recent years. In the United States, campaign finances are regulated by the Federal
        Election Comission (FEC), but these regulations are generally more lenient than similar regulations enforced in the UK. By focusing on elections to the
        House of Representatives in 2020 - which has the most comprehensive campaign finance data available - this project seeks to investigate the extent to which
        campaign finances influence the outcome of elections, while also considering why some campaigns raise more money than others. </p> 
    <h2> The relationship between campaign finances and election outcomes </h2> 
    <p> In order to create a dataset detailing the outcome of elections in 2020, I <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/politico_scraping.py">scraped</a>
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/politico_2020_house.csv">data</a> 
        from <a class="textLink" href="https://www.politico.com">Politico </a>. I also 
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/open_secrets_scraping.py">scraped</a> 
        data from <a class="textLink" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/">OpenSecrets</a> to obtain financial
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_finances_2020_open_secrets.csv">data</a> 
        for candidates in these elections. </p> 
    <p> These sources had data with differing formatting, as field such as candidate and district name had contrasting formats. In order to produce a useable
        <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_2020_results_and_finances_final.csv">dataset</a>
        I merged and cleaned data from these sources in <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/politico_open_secrets_merge_clean.py">Python</a>.
        I also had to drop some data, as not all house seats had financial data available for all candidates. The following chart plots a regression of a candidate's final
        vote share against the percentage of the total money in their seat they were responsible for spending/raising. </p>        
    <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>
    <p> We then consider the total spent on each seat. </p>
    <p> We can <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/district_totals.py">manipulate</a>
        our dataset to produce a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/district_totals_2020.csv">dataset</a>
        showing the totals for each district. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
    <p> One theory is that more money is spent on seats which are expected to be closely-fought, so we can consider if there is a correlation (which we expect to be negative) between margin of victory and total money spent. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div> 
    <p> We then plot a map showing where the most was spent. </p> 
    <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
    <p> We see this seems to track with wealthy states. </p> 
    <p> We then use census data to consider whether household income correlates with amount spent on each seat. </p> 
    <p> So we use census <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/census_household_income_2019.csv">data</a>
        and <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/household_income_merge.py">merge</a>
        it to produce a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/district_totals_household_income_2020.csv">dataset.</a></p>
    <p> We then plot a map or correlation showing whether that correlates. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>
    <p> We then consider if in-state funding matters. </p>
    <p> We use data from <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/house_2020_in_out_district_open_secrets.csv">OpenSecrets</a>
        and <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/in_out_district_merge.py">clean</a> 
        it to produce a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_2020/in_distr_raised_2020.csv">dataset.</a></p>
    <p> We then plot a graph showing whether in-state funding matters, and compare to normal funding. </p> 
    <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div> 
    <p> We access data from MIT's Election <a class="textLink" href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/data">Lab</a> to get data on House results in both 2018 and 2020.
        We first cleaned this data slightly in excel, before <a class="textLink hrref="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/code_snippets/results_clean_2018_2020.py">manipulating</a> 
        it in python to create a <a class="textLink" href="https://github.com/Jacob-McLaughlin/Jacob-McLaughlin.github.io/blob/main/project/data/house_winners_2018_2020.csv">dataset</a>.</p> 
    <p> We now do a map of the winners. </p>
