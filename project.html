    <h1> Outline </h1>
    <p> The project must consist of between 3 and 8 charts, tables and visualisations. </p>
    <p> The project must discuss four topics: 1. The aims of the project, 2. the data you used, how you accessed it including notes on automation/replication, 3. Challenges in data cleaning or analysis and the tools you used to overcome them, 4. Your conclusions. </p>
    <p> The written text of the project must not exceed 800 words. </p> 
    <p> The criteria used to assess the project are given below. </p>
    <h2> Criteria </h2>
    <h3> 1. Accessibility </h3>
    <p> a. Hosted on a GitHub page - open data approach. </p>
    <p> b. Clear links to data and notes in your code. </p>
    <p> Mobile first: site should be clear on a smartphone screen. </p>
    <h3> 2. Empirical Design </h3>
    <p> a. Clarity of question </p>
    <p> b. Choice of data sets </p>
    <p> c. Empirical approach </p>
    <h3> 3. Automation </h3>
    <p> a. Use of APIs </p>
    <p> b. Replicability of project </p>
    <h3> 4. Impact </h3>
    <p> a. Key takeaways from the project </p>
    <p> b. Interactivity of the data </p>
    <h3> 5. Description </h3>
    <p> a. Clarity of write up </p>
    <p> b. Logical steps from data to conclusions </p>
    <p> c. Does the project stimulate further work? </p>
<h1>Data Science Project</h1>
    <p> I scraped data from politico to get data on 2020 election outcomes for house seats. </p>
    <p> I then scraped data from OpenSecrets to get financial data for house seats in the 2020 election. </p>
    <h1> How does campaign finance spending affect elections to the US House of Representatives? </h1>
    <h2> Aims </h2>
    <p> We begin by scraping data from Politico and Open Secrets. </p>
    <p> The code to scrape and merge these datasets and the final dataset can be found here. </p>
    <p> We then plot graphs showing correlation between amount spent and vote share. </p>
    <p> We then consider the total spent on each seat. </p>
    <p> We create a dataset showing that which can be found here. </p> 
    <p> We then plot a map showing where the most was spent. </p> 
    <p> We see this seems to track with wealthy states. </p> 
    <p> We then use census data to consider whether household income correlates with amount spent on each seat. </p> 
    <p> We create this dataset using this code. </p> 
    <p> We then plot a map or correlation showing whether that correlates. </p>
    <p> We then consider if in-state funding matters. </p>
    <p> We use data from OpenSecrets and merge with this code to create this dataset. </p> 
    <p> We then plot a graph showing whether in-state funding matters, and compare to normal funding. </p>
